**Do you know how easy you can run your own Flashcards games in Google Assistant?** Recently, I started learning Spanish in my free time. I faced the challenge of memorizing many new words. Unfortunately, there was no free application in the AppStore that would allow me to add my own words. Google Actions came to the rescue. In less than 10 minutes I launched my chatbot with whom I can learn new words.

1. [Open Google Actions](https://console.actions.google.com/u/0/) and create a New Project
