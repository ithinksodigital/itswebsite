**Do you know how easy you can run your own Flashcards games in Google Assistant?** Recently, I started learning Spanish in my free time. I faced the challenge of memorizing many new words. Unfortunately, there was no free application in the AppStore that would allow me to add my own words. Google Actions came to the rescue. In less than 10 minutes I launched my chatbot with whom I can learn new words.

1. [Open Google Actions](https://console.actions.google.com/u/0/) and create a New Project

   Type your project name and choose Games next Flash cards! Yes that's easy as it is! Google has shared many templates which you can use for free.
2. Choose your new bot name-  users say or type this name to begin interacting with it, and your Google Assistant voice. 
3. Now the most important thing, you have to feed your bot with the words you want to repeat.

   From the left hand menu choose Actions and click Get started. Google will offer you to open and copy a properly prepared template where you need to add your own content. After that copy the URL of your newly created sheet and pass into form.

4. That's basically enough. You can test the application in Google Actions or call it from your Google Assistant (remember to be logged in to the same account where you created app). If you want, you can share the application with the world - add a privacy policy, some necessary information and send it to Google employees for verification.

   Let's play!
